Tired of constantly running out of power? Frustrated when your turrets shut down at the worst possible moment during a raid? Want to focus on developing your colony, trading, or waging war without worrying about wires and generators?

This simple mod is for you. It doesn’t add anything complicated — just two buildings that will solve all your electricity problems once and for all.


What the mod adds:

The mod introduces two new power sources:

Cheat Reactor: A powerful and reliable energy source, more than enough to cover the needs of a medium or even large colony.
        
Pro Cheat Reactor: An absurdly powerful generator for those who need to power absolutely everything. Perfect for massive bases, testing, or just playing without a care.
